	<h2><a name = "What is XHTML & CSS?"></a>What is XHTML & CSS?</h2>
		<p>
		XHTML and CSS are the code standards that make websites work. By right clicking on any blank space on a website, and clicking on "view page source" you can see the code behind any website. Websites are basically just text files that use a web browser as a compiler, so all you need is a simple text editor to design a website. You can use more complicated Integrated Development Environments or IDE, but for simple programming, Notepad ++ works just as well. 
		</p>
	<h3><a name = "Tags"></a>Tags</h3>
		<p>
		XHTML revolves around tags! Every component in a website is contained within a tag. The first tag declares the doctype, in this case it would be < html >. Below are some common tags used in html:</br>
		</p>
		<p>
		Paragraphs: < p > < / p >  -->  Everything you put in between the opening and closing tags gets put into a separate paragraph.</br>
		Line Breaks: < br > < / br >  -->  Everything you put in between the opening and closing tags will go into the next line.</br>
		Horizontal Line: < hr > < / hr >  -->   Puts a horizontal line under the text in between the tags. </br>
		Bold: < strong > < / strong >  -->  Makes the text bold. </br>
		Italicize: < em > < / em >  -->  Italicizes the enclosed text. </br>
		Header: < h1 > ... < h6 > --> Creates the enclosed text into a header. The size/ importance of the header is determined by the number after the h. A header with h1 has the most priority and will look the biggest while a header with h6 will be of least priority and will appear the smallest. Headers range from h1 to h6.</br>
		Hyperlinks: < a href "..." > < / a >  -->  Paste a link in between the " " and the title of your hyperlink will be the enclosed text.</br> 
		Page Navigation: < a href "#..." > < / a >  -->  Essentially the same as Hyperlinks, but instead, in the " " an in the enclosed text area, put the title of the paragraph. When someone clicks on the name of the paragraph, the site will direct them to that paragraph. Similar to Wikipedia. </br>
		</p>
	<h4><a name = "Scope, Head, Body"></a>Scope, Head, Body</h4>
		<p>
		The head of a site includes information for the browser. The information in the head is seen by the user of the site. It includes keywords for search engines, the title of the website, browser information etc. You can create a header for your website using the tag, "title". It is used the same as any other tag where the text is inserted in between the opening and closing tags. The header should only appear in between the < head > and < / head > tags and nothing else. The body of the site includes all of the actual site content, including paragraphs, images, audio, animations, backrounds, and so on. All of the body functions including the tags discussed above should be included between the < body > and < / body > tags. </br>
		</p>
	<h5><a name = "Tool tips"></a>Important function</h5>
		<p>
		Tool tips allows the user to hover over elements of a page for further explanation of what they do. If a link is not very descriptive, such as if it says "Google is awesome!" the user can hold their curser over the text/link, which will tell them "Google home page" so that they know where the link is taking them. To do this just put title = "..."</br>
	<h6><a name = "Adding an Image"></a>Adding an Image</h6>
