--Python: a programming lang. created by Guido Van Rossum- in 1980's netherlands
	-every program translates assembly code and source code
	-complier(used in C) trans. all of source code (complied lang.)into machine code bef. it can be run=run 
faster for certain tasks
	-interpreter translates source code(interpreted langs.) into machine codeas it is being run 
	-specific to python: carries some characteristics of complied + intp. lang.
		*code is complied-not put into machine code that can directly be executed by processor
		*coplies source code into bytecode-intermediate btwn source code + comp. proccessor
		*you execute complied code-Python intp. trans. bytecode into machine code as it runs
		*carries some adv. or complied and intp. lang.s
